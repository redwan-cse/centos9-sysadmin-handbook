# Service Management and Logging

SystemD is the default init system and service manager in CentOS 9. It manages system services and processes.

## Systemd

Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is designed to manage the initialization process, control system services, and supervise system processes. Systemd replaces the traditional SysV init system and brings many enhancements, including parallel startup processes, dependency-based service management, and centralized logging.

Key features of Systemd include:

- **Unit Files**: Systemd manages services, devices, mount points, and other system resources through unit files, which define configuration parameters and dependencies.

- **Parallel Startup**: Systemd initializes system services concurrently, speeding up the boot process by executing tasks in parallel when possible.

- **Dependency Management**: Systemd enables explicit and implicit dependencies between services, ensuring that services start and stop in the correct order.

- **Service Supervision**: Systemd monitors and restarts services automatically if they fail, improving system reliability and availability.

- **Centralized Logging**: Systemd integrates with the journal logging system, providing a centralized and structured approach to system logging and troubleshooting.

Overall, Systemd provides a modern and efficient framework for managing system initialization, services, and processes on Linux distributions.


### Systemctl Commands
Systemctl is the primary tool for managing services in SystemD.

- View service status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status <service_name>
```
- Enable a service to start on boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable <service_name>
```
- Disable a service from starting on boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
```
- Start a service:
```bash
sudo systemctl start <service_name>
```
- Stop a service:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop <service_name>
```
- Restart a service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart <service_name>
```
- Reload configuration changes for a service:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload <service_name>
```

### Viewing a SystemD Unit Files
Unit files define how SystemD manages services.

- View SSH service unit file:
```bash
sudo cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service
```

## Logging with Journalctl

### Basic Usage
Journalctl is used to query and view logs managed by SystemD's journal.

- View all logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl
```
- View logs for a specific service (e.g., SSH):
```bash
sudo journalctl -u sshd
```
- View the last 5 lines of SSH logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -n 5 -u sshd
```
- Follow logs for a service:
```bash
sudo journalctl -fu sshd
```
- View logs in reverse order:
```bash
sudo journalctl -r -u sshd
```
- View logs with a specific priority level (e.g., error, info, warning):
```bash
sudo journalctl -p err -u sshd
sudo journalctl -p info -u sshd
sudo journalctl -p warning -u sshd
```
- View logs since a specific time:
```bash
sudo journalctl --since "-1 hours"
```
- View logs within a specific time range:
```bash
sudo journalctl --since "2024-04-23 05:40:00" --until "2024-04-23 06:40:00"
```

## Simple Web With Apache

Setting up a basic web server with Apache HTTP Server.

- **Install Apache**: Install Apache HTTP Server:
```bash
sudo dnf install httpd
```
### Example: Managing Apache HTTP Server
```bash
# Enable Apache HTTP Server to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable httpd

# Stop Apache HTTP Server
sudo systemctl stop httpd

# View status of Apache HTTP Server
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

- **Firewall Configuration**: Allow HTTP traffic through the firewall:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
- **Alternative Firewall Configuration**: Alternatively, allow the HTTP service:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
- **View Apache Logs**: View Apache log files:
```bash
sudo ls -la /var/log/httpd
```
- **Check DocumentRoot**: Check the DocumentRoot directory configured in Apache:
```bash
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep "DocumentRoot"
```
- **Default Index Page**: Place your website files in `/var/www/html` directory. The default index page is located at `/var/www/html/index.html`.
- **Reload Apache**: Reload Apache to apply configuration changes without restarting:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload httpd
```
