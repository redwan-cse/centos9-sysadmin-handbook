# User and Group Management in CentOS Stream 9

User and group management is a fundamental aspect of system administration, allowing administrators to control access to resources and assign permissions within a Linux environment. In this document, we will cover the basic commands and concepts for managing users and groups in CentOS Stream 9.

## User Management

### Creating Users

To create a new user, you can use the `useradd` command followed by the username. For example:

```bash
sudo useradd username
```

### Setting Passwords

After creating a user, you should set a password using the `passwd` command:

```bash
sudo passwd username
```

### Modifying User Properties

To modify user properties such as the home directory or shell, you can use the `usermod` command:

```bash
# Changing Home Directory
sudo usermod -d /new/home/directory username
# Changing Default Shell
sudo usermod -s /bin/bash username
```

### Deleting Users

To delete a user account, you can use the `userdel` command:

```bash
sudo userdel username
```

### Password Management:

CentOS, like many Linux distributions, uses the `passwd` command for password management. Users can change their own passwords using the `passwd` command without any options. For system administrators, password management involves enforcing password policies, managing password aging, and ensuring the security of user passwords.

To enforce password policies, you would typically configure the `/etc/login.defs` file to set parameters such as minimum and maximum password age, password complexity requirements, and password history.


## Group Management

### Creating Groups

To create a new group, you can use the `groupadd` command followed by the group name:

```bash
sudo groupadd groupname
```

### Adding Users to Groups

To add a user to a group, you can use the `usermod` command with the `-aG` option:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```

### Modifying Group Properties

To modify group properties, such as the group name, you can use the `groupmod` command:

```bash
sudo groupmod -n newgroupname oldgroupname
```

### Deleting Groups

To delete a group, you can use the `groupdel` command:

```bash
sudo groupdel groupname
```

## User and Group Membership Management:

Managing user and group memberships involves commands such as `usermod` and `gpasswd`.

- **Check Group Membership**: To check the membership of a specific group, you can use the `getent` command followed by the group name:

    ```bash
    getent group groupname
    ```

- **User Membership Management**: To add or remove a user from a group, you can use the `usermod` command with the `-aG` option to append the user to the group:

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG groupname username
    ```

- **Group Membership Management**: To manage group memberships, you can use the `gpasswd` command. For example, to add a user to a group:

    ```bash
    sudo gpasswd -a username groupname
    ```

    And to remove a user from a group:

    ```bash
    sudo gpasswd -d username groupname
    ```

## User and Group Permission Management:

File and directory permissions in CentOS are managed using `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` commands.

### `chmod` Command:

The `chmod` command allows users to change the permissions of files and directories.

#### Symbolic Mode:

Symbolic mode allows users to modify permissions using symbols representing user classes (`u` for user/owner, `g` for group, `o` for others), permissions (`r` for read, `w` for write, `x` for execute), and operators (`+` for adding permissions, `-` for removing permissions, `=` for setting permissions).

Examples:

- To give read and write permissions to the owner of a file:
  ```bash
  chmod u+rw filename
  ```

- To remove execute permissions for the group and others from a directory:
  ```bash
  chmod go-x directory
  ```

#### Numeric Mode:

Numeric mode represents permissions using octal numbers.

- `4` (read): Allows read access.
- `2` (write): Allows write access.
- `1` (execute): Allows execute access.

To set permissions numerically, add the numbers corresponding to the desired permissions for user, group, and others. For example:

- To give read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, and read permissions to the group and others:
  ```bash
  chmod 755 filename
  ```

### `chown` Command:

The `chown` command changes the owner and group of files and directories.

Examples:

- To change the owner of a file:
  ```bash
  chown newowner filename
  ```

- To change both owner and group of a directory:
  ```bash
  chown newowner:newgroup directory
  ```

- To change the ownership of all files and subdirectories within a directory recursively, you can use the `-R` option:

  ```bash
  sudo chown -R username:groupname /path/to/directory
  ```

### `chgrp` Command:

The `chgrp` command changes the group ownership of files and directories.

Example:

- To change the group of a file:
  ```bash
  chgrp newgroup filename
  ```


### Additional Commands

- To list all users on the system, you can use the `cat` command to display the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file:

  ```bash
  cat /etc/passwd
  ```

- To list all groups on the system, you can use the `cat` command to display the contents of the `/etc/group` file:

  ```bash
  cat /etc/group
  ```

- You can also use the `id` command to display information about a specific user or group:

  ```bash
  id username
  id groupname
  ```
