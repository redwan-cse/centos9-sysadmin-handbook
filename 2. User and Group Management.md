# User and Group Management in CentOS Stream 9

User and group management is a fundamental aspect of system administration, allowing administrators to control access to resources and assign permissions within a Linux environment. In this document, we will cover the basic commands and concepts for managing users and groups in CentOS Stream 9.

## User Management

### Creating Users

To create a new user, you can use the `useradd` command followed by the username. For example:

```bash
sudo useradd username
```

### Setting Passwords

After creating a user, you should set a password using the `passwd` command:

```bash
sudo passwd username
```

### Modifying User Properties

To modify user properties such as the home directory or shell, you can use the `usermod` command:

```bash
# Changing Home Directory
sudo usermod -d /new/home/directory username
# Changing Default Shell
sudo usermod -s /bin/bash username
```

### Deleting Users

To delete a user account, you can use the `userdel` command:

```bash
sudo userdel username
```

## Group Management

### Creating Groups

To create a new group, you can use the `groupadd` command followed by the group name:

```bash
sudo groupadd groupname
```

### Adding Users to Groups

To add a user to a group, you can use the `usermod` command with the `-aG` option:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```

### Modifying Group Properties

To modify group properties, such as the group name, you can use the `groupmod` command:

```bash
sudo groupmod -n newgroupname oldgroupname
```

### Deleting Groups

To delete a group, you can use the `groupdel` command:

```bash
sudo groupdel groupname
```

## Additional Commands and Tips

- To list all users on the system, you can use the `cat` command to display the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file:

  ```bash
  cat /etc/passwd
  ```

- To list all groups on the system, you can use the `cat` command to display the contents of the `/etc/group` file:

  ```bash
  cat /etc/group
  ```

- You can also use the `id` command to display information about a specific user or group:

  ```bash
  id username
  id groupname
  ```

- Always ensure to follow security best practices when managing users and groups, such as assigning the least privilege necessary and regularly reviewing user permissions.
