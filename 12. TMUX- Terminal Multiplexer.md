# TMUX - Terminal Multiplexer

TMUX is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to create and manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window. It provides features for session management, window splitting, and session detachment, making it a powerful tool for organizing and multitasking in the terminal.

## Installation

To install TMUX on CentOS 9:

```bash
sudo dnf install tmux
```

## Getting Started

Start TMUX by simply typing:

```bash
tmux
```

## Basic Usage

### Keybindings

- **Prefix Key**: By default, the prefix key combination is `CTRL+B`. This is used as a prefix for issuing commands in TMUX.

### Session Management

- **Detach Session**: To detach from a TMUX session and leave it running in the background, press `CTRL+B`, then `D`.
- **List Sessions**: To list active TMUX sessions:
  ```bash
  tmux list-sessions
  ```
- **Attach to Session**: To attach to a detached TMUX session:
  ```bash
  tmux attach
  ```
- **Attach to Specific Session**: To attach to a specific TMUX session by name or number:
  ```bash
  tmux attach -t <session_name_or_number>
  ```
- **Close Session**: To close a TMUX session, simply exit all terminals within the session or use `exit`.

### Window Management

- **Create New Window**: To create a new window within the current session:
  ```bash
  tmux new-window
  ```
- **Switch Windows**:
  - Previous Window: `Prefix + p`
  - Next Window: `Prefix + n`
- **Kill Window**: To close the current window:
  ```bash
  Prefix + x
  ```
- **Horizontal Split**: To split the current window horizontally:
  ```bash
  Shift + 5
  ```
- **Vertical Split**: To split the current window vertically:
  ```bash
  Shift + "
  ```

### Pane Management

- **Switch Panes**: Use `Prefix` followed by arrow keys to switch between panes.
- **Close Pane**: To close the current pane, simply exit all terminals within the pane or use `exit`.

### Example Workflow

1. Start TMUX: `tmux`
2. Create new window: `Prefix + c`
3. Split window horizontally: `Shift + 5`
4. Split window vertically: `Shift + "`
5. Navigate between panes: `Prefix + arrow keys`
6. Detach from TMUX: `Prefix + D`
7. List sessions: `tmux list-sessions`
8. Attach to a session: `tmux attach -t <session_name_or_number>`

TMUX provides a versatile environment for managing terminal sessions and windows, allowing you to customize your workflow and increase productivity in the terminal.
