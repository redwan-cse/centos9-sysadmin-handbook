# File System Management


## Basics of File Systems

### Components of a File System
- **Inodes**: Data structures that store metadata about files (e.g., permissions, ownership, timestamps).
- **Data Blocks**: Actual content of files.
- **Directories**: Organize files and subdirectories hierarchically.
- **File Attributes**: Permissions, ownership, timestamps, and extended attributes.

## Creating, Mounting, and Unmounting File Systems

### Creating File Systems
1. **mkfs**: Create a file system on a device (e.g., `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1`).
2. **LVM (Logical Volume Manager)**: Create logical volumes and format them.

### Mounting File Systems
1. **Mount Points**: Directories where file systems are attached.
2. Edit `/etc/fstab` to configure automatic mounts during boot.

### Unmounting File Systems
1. **umount**: Safely unmount a file system (e.g., `umount /mnt/data`).

## Managing Disk Space

### Checking Disk Usage
1. **df**: Display disk space usage (e.g., `df -h`).
2. **du**: Analyze directory space usage (e.g., `du -sh /var`).


## Search
Let's create a sample log file with some text, and then search for specific words using `grep`.

1. **Create a Sample Log File**:
   Let's create a file named `sample.log` with some example content. You can replace this content with your actual log data.

    ```bash
    echo "This is a log file containing various messages." > sample.log
    echo "System error: Disk space is running low." >> sample.log
    echo "User login: User 'admin' logged in successfully." >> sample.log
    echo "Application log: Process completed without errors." >> sample.log
    ```

2. **Search for Specific Words**:
   Suppose the system admin wants to search for occurrences of the words "error" and "login" in the log file. They can use `grep` as follows:

    ```bash
    grep -i 'error\|login' sample.log
    ```

   Explanation:
   - `-i`: Ignore case (so it matches "Error" or "ERROR").
   - `'error\|login'`: Search for lines containing either "error" or "login".
