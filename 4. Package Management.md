# Package Management

In CentOS Stream 9, the default package manager is `dnf`, which is a modernized and improved version of `yum`. `dnf` is used for installing, updating, and managing software packages on the system.

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/yum
ls -l /usr/bin/dnf
ls -l /usr/bin/dnf-3
```

Here's how you can perform basic package management tasks:

### Installation:

To install a package, use the `dnf install` command followed by the name of the package:

```bash
sudo dnf install package_name
```

For example, to install the `nginx` web server:

```bash
sudo dnf install nginx
```

### Uninstallation:

To uninstall a package, use the `dnf remove` command followed by the name of the package:

```bash
sudo dnf remove package_name
```

For example, to uninstall the `nginx` web server:

```bash
sudo dnf remove nginx
```

### Updating:

To update all installed packages to the latest version, use the `dnf update` command:

```bash
sudo dnf update
```

### Listing Installed Packages:

To list all installed packages, you can use the `dnf list installed` command:

```bash
dnf list installed
```

### Searching for Packages:

To search for available packages matching a keyword, use the `dnf search` command:

```bash
dnf search keyword
```

For example, to search for packages related to the web server:

```bash
dnf search web server
```

## Installing Additional Software: Extending CentOS with External Repositories

Before installing certain packages, it may be necessary to add additional repositories to your system. Repositories contain collections of software packages that are not included in the default CentOS Stream repositories. 

### Adding a Repository

The EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository is a popular choice for additional packages.

- Navigate to the directory to check containing repository configuration files:

   ```bash
   cd /etc/yum.repos.d
   ```

- Install the `epel-release` package, which provides the necessary repository configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install epel-release
   ```

#### Searching for a Package

Once you have added the desired repositories, you can search for available packages using the `dnf search` command followed by the package name or keyword. For example, to search for the `htop` utility:

   ```bash
   dnf search htop
   ```

This command will provide a list of packages related to `htop`, including the package name and description.

#### Installing a Package

After identifying the desired package, you can install it using the `dnf install` command followed by the package name. For example, to install `htop`:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install htop
   ```

This command will download and install the `htop` package along with any necessary dependencies.
