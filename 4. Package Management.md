# Package Management

In CentOS Stream 9, the default package manager is `dnf`, which is a modernized and improved version of `yum`. `dnf` is used for installing, updating, and managing software packages on the system. Here's how you can perform basic package management tasks:

### Installation:

To install a package, use the `dnf install` command followed by the name of the package:

```bash
sudo dnf install package_name
```

For example, to install the `nginx` web server:

```bash
sudo dnf install nginx
```

### Uninstallation:

To uninstall a package, use the `dnf remove` command followed by the name of the package:

```bash
sudo dnf remove package_name
```

For example, to uninstall the `nginx` web server:

```bash
sudo dnf remove nginx
```

### Updating:

To update all installed packages to the latest version, use the `dnf update` command:

```bash
sudo dnf update
```

### Listing Installed Packages:

To list all installed packages, you can use the `dnf list installed` command:

```bash
dnf list installed
```

### Searching for Packages:

To search for available packages matching a keyword, use the `dnf search` command:

```bash
dnf search keyword
```

For example, to search for packages related to the web server:

```bash
dnf search web server
```
