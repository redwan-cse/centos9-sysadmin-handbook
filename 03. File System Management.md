# File System Management


## Basics of File Systems

### Components of a File System
- **Inodes**: Data structures that store metadata about files (e.g., permissions, ownership, timestamps).
- **Data Blocks**: Actual content of files.
- **Directories**: Organize files and subdirectories hierarchically.
- **File Attributes**: Permissions, ownership, timestamps, and extended attributes.

## Creating, Mounting, and Unmounting File Systems

### Creating File Systems
1. **mkfs**: Create a file system on a device (e.g., `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1`).
2. **LVM (Logical Volume Manager)**: Create logical volumes and format them.

### Mounting File Systems
1. **Mount Points**: Directories where file systems are attached.
2. Edit `/etc/fstab` to configure automatic mounts during boot.

### Unmounting File Systems
1. **umount**: Safely unmount a file system (e.g., `umount /mnt/data`).

## Managing Disk Space

### Checking Disk Usage
1. **df**: Display disk space usage (e.g., `df -h`).
2. **du**: Analyze directory space usage (e.g., `du -sh /var`).


## Search
Let's create a sample log file with some text, and then search for specific words using `grep`.

1. **Create a Sample Log File**:
   Let's create a file named `sample.log` with some example content. You can replace this content with your actual log data.

    ```bash
    echo "This is a log file containing various messages." > sample.log
    echo "System error: Disk space is running low." >> sample.log
    echo "User login: User 'admin' logged in successfully." >> sample.log
    echo "Application log: Process completed without errors." >> sample.log
    ```

2. **Search for Specific Words**:
   Suppose the system admin wants to search for occurrences of the words "error" and "login" in the log file. They can use `grep` as follows:

    ```bash
    grep -i 'error\|login' sample.log
    ```

   Explanation:
   - `-i`: Ignore case (so it matches "Error" or "ERROR").
   - `'error\|login'`: Search for lines containing either "error" or "login".


Absolutely, let's incorporate information about mounting and unmounting drives in the document:


## Partitioning an External Drive

Partitioning an external drive allows you to organize and allocate storage space effectively. This section demonstrates how to partition an external drive using `fdisk` and then mount it as backup storage. Before proceeding, ensure that the external drive you wish to partition is connected to your system.


### Step 1: Identify the External Drive

To identify the external drive and its partitions, use the `lsblk` command:

```bash
lsblk
```

### Step 2: Partition the External Drive

Use `fdisk` to partition the external drive. Replace `/dev/sdb` with the appropriate device name for your external drive:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```

Within the `fdisk` utility, you can perform various actions such as printing existing partitions (`p`), for help (`m`), creating a new partition (`n`), setting partition type (`t`), etc. After making changes, don't forget to save them (`w`) and exit.

### Step 3: Format Partitions

Format the newly created partitions with a filesystem. For example, to format a partition as XFS:

```bash
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1 -L "LinuxBackup"
```

### Mounting the Partition

Mounting a partition makes it accessible to the system.

#### Mounting the Partition Temporarily

To temporarily mount the partition to a directory on your system:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/linux_part/
```

#### Mounting the Partition Permanently

To mount the partition automatically every time the system boots:

1. Identify the UUID of the partition:

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/sdb1
```

2. Edit the `/etc/fstab` file and add a line similar to the following:

```
UUID=c9994541-204a-4b94-a6d9-38027e562842 /mnt/linux_part xfs defaults 0 1
```

### Unmounting the Partition

Unmounting a partition safely detaches it from the system.

To unmount a partition:

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdb1
```
