# System Resource Monitoring and Troubleshooting

## Introduction
System resource monitoring is crucial for ensuring the optimal performance and stability of a system. By regularly monitoring resource usage such as memory, disk space, network activity, and processes, administrators can identify potential issues and take proactive measures to address them.

## Monitoring CPU Usage

### `htop`
- Command: `htop`
- Description: An interactive process viewer for Linux.
- Installation:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install epel-release
  sudo dnf install htop
  ```
- Example:
  ```bash
  htop
  ```
- Note: Press `F9` in `htop` to kill a process.

**Load Average**: Monitor the load average and ensure it's within acceptable limits relative to the number of CPU cores available.

### `top`
- Command: `top`
- Description: Displays real-time information about running processes.
- Example:
  ```bash
  top
  ```

## Monitoring Memory Usage

### `free`
- Command: `free`
- Description: Displays the amount of free and used memory in the system.
- Example:
  ```bash
  free -h
  ```

### `vmstat`
- Command: `vmstat`
- Description: Reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and CPU activity.
- Example:
  ```bash
  vmstat
  ``
## Monitoring Disk Usage

### `df` and `du`
- Commands: `df`, `du`
- Description: Displays disk space usage information (`df`) and estimates file space usage (`du`).
- Examples:
  ```bash
  df -h
  du -sh /path/to/directory
 
  ```
## Network Monitoring Tools

### `netstat`, `tcpdump`and `iftop`
- Commands: `netstat`, `tcpdump`, `iftop`
- Description: Tools for monitoring network activity.
- Examples:
  ```bash
  netstat -tuln
  tcpdump -i eth0
  iftop
  ```

## Managing Processes

### Listing Processes
- Command: `ps`
- Example:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep <process_name>
  ```

### Killing Processes
- Commands: `kill`, `killall`
- Example: 
  To kill a process by its PID:
  ```bash
  kill <pid>
  ```
  To force kill a process:
  ```bash
  kill -9 <pid>
  ```
  To kill all processes with a certain name (e.g., "gedit"):
  ```bash
  killall gedit
  ```
**kill -9**: The kill command in Linux is used to terminate processes. The -9 option is a signal number that specifies which signal to send to the process. In this case, -9 sends the SIGKILL signal. It forces the process to terminate immediately without giving it a chance to do any cleanup or handle the signal gracefully.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. High CPU Usage
- **Symptoms**: Sluggish performance, unresponsiveness.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Identify the process(es) causing high CPU usage using tools like `top`, `htop`, or `ps`.
  - Investigate the cause of the high CPU usage (e.g., runaway processes, inefficient code).
  - Take appropriate action, such as optimizing code, restarting problematic services, or adjusting system configurations.

### 2. Memory Leaks
- **Symptoms**: Gradual increase in memory usage over time, system instability, crashes.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Monitor memory usage using tools like `free`, `vmstat`, or `htop`.
  - Identify processes with abnormal memory consumption.
  - Investigate potential memory leaks in applications or services.
  - Implement fixes such as restarting affected services, applying patches, or optimizing memory usage.

### 3. Disk Space Exhaustion
- **Symptoms**: Error messages indicating insufficient disk space, system slowdowns.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Check disk space usage using `df`.
  - Identify large files or directories consuming disk space with `du`.
  - Delete unnecessary files or move them to other storage.
  - Consider resizing partitions or adding more disk space if necessary.

### 4. Network Connectivity Issues
- **Symptoms**: Unable to access network resources, slow network performance.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Use tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, or `netstat` to diagnose network connectivity.
  - Check network configuration settings, including IP addresses, DNS servers, and routing tables.
  - Verify physical network connections and hardware devices (e.g., NICs, routers).
  - Investigate firewall rules and security policies that may be blocking network traffic.

### 5. Application Errors and Crashes
- **Symptoms**: Application crashes, error messages, unexpected behavior.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Review application logs for error messages and stack traces.
  - Check system logs (e.g., `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/syslog`) for related issues.
  - Update or reinstall the application to the latest version.
  - Analyze any recent changes or updates that may have triggered the issue.

### 6. Security Breaches or Intrusions
- **Symptoms**: Unauthorized access, unusual activity, data breaches.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Review system logs and security event logs for suspicious activities.
  - Identify potential vulnerabilities or security gaps in the system.
  - Implement security measures such as firewall rules, access controls, and intrusion detection systems.
  - Conduct thorough security audits and penetration tests to identify and patch vulnerabilities.

### 7. System Hangs or Kernel Panics
- **Symptoms**: System becomes unresponsive, kernel panic messages on console.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Analyze kernel panic messages and stack traces to identify the cause.
  - Check hardware components (e.g., RAM, CPU, disks) for faults or failures.
  - Review system configuration and software updates for compatibility issues.
  - Consider reverting recent changes or updates that may have triggered the issue.
