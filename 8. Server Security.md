# Server Security Enhancements

## 1. Firewall Management
In CentOS, the firewall management is typically done using the `firewalld` service:

### Understanding Firewall Commands:

1. **firewalld**: This is the default firewall management tool in CentOS. It provides a dynamic and flexible way of managing firewall rules.

2. **firewall-cmd**: This is the command-line interface for managing `firewalld`. It allows you to add, remove, and modify firewall rules.

3. **zones**: firewalld organizes network interfaces into different zones, each with its own set of predefined rules. Common zones include `public`, `home`, `work`, and `trusted`.

### Installation:

Before managing the firewall, ensure that the `firewalld` service is installed on your CentOS system. If not, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install firewalld
```

Once installed, start the `firewalld` service to ensure it starts automatically upon system boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start firewalld
```

Once started, enable / disable the `firewalld` service using following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable firewalld
sudo systemctl disable firewalld
```

### Firewall Rules Example:

#### Viewing Available Zones:

Zones define the level of trust for a particular network interface. You can view available zones using the following command:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --get-zones
```

#### Listing Active Zones:

To view which zones are currently active, use the following command:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```

#### Setting Default Zone:

You can set the default zone for `firewalld`. For example, to set the default zone to `public`, use the following command:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=public
```

#### Opening Ports:

To allow incoming traffic on specific ports, you need to open those ports in the firewall. For example, to open port 80 for HTTP traffic, use the following command:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanent
```

This command adds a permanent rule to allow TCP traffic on port 80 in the `public` zone.

#### Enabling Services:

Alternatively, you can allow traffic for specific services instead of individual ports. For example, to enable HTTP service (which uses port 80), use the following command:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
```

#### Reloading Firewall:

After adding or modifying rules, reload the firewall to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Enabling SSH Port on the Firewall:

To enable SSH port (port 22) on the firewall, you need to add a rule to allow inbound traffic on that port.

1. **Check Available Services**:
   You can list the available services by typing:

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --get-services
   ```

   This will list all the services that can be used to open ports.

2. **Check Current Zone**:
   Identify the zone to which your network interface is assigned. By default, it is often `public`.

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
   ```

3. **Add SSH Service to Firewall**:
   You can add the SSH service to the firewall's allowed services:

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=ssh --permanent
   ```

   This command adds the SSH service to the `public` zone permanently.

4. **Reload Firewall**:
   After adding the rule, reload the firewall to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

5. **Verify SSH Service**:
   Confirm that SSH is allowed in the firewall:

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --list-services
   ```

   This will list all the services allowed in the active zone.

6. **Check Ports**:
   You can also check the open ports specifically:

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
   ```

   This will list all open ports in the active zone.

### Additional Tips:

- If you're using a different zone than `public`, replace `public` with the appropriate zone in the commands above.
- If you need to enable SSH on a different port (not the default port 22), replace `--add-service=ssh` with `--add-port=PORT_NUMBER/tcp`.
- Always verify firewall settings after making changes to ensure the desired configuration is applied.


## 2. Disabling root login
Disabling root login is an important security measure to protect your system from unauthorized access and potential security threats. Here's how you can disable root login in CentOS :

### Step 1: Create a New Administrative User

Before disabling root login, ensure that you have created a new administrative user with sudo privileges. This user will be used to perform administrative tasks instead of the root user.

```bash
sudo useradd -m newusername  # Create a new user
sudo passwd newusername      # Set a password for the new user
sudo usermod -aG wheel newusername  # Add the user to the sudo group
```

Replace `newusername` with the desired username for the new administrative user.

### Step 2: Edit SSH Configuration

1. Open the SSH configuration file in a text editor. You need root privileges to do this:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

2. Look for the line containing `PermitRootLogin` and modify it to disable root login. Change `yes` to `no`:

```
PermitRootLogin no
```

### Step 3: Restart SSH Service

After making the changes, save the file and exit the text editor. Then, restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Step 4: Test New Configuration

Try logging in to your server using the root user. You should receive a message indicating that the root login is disabled. Use the new administrative user created earlier to log in and perform administrative tasks.


## Setting Up Passwordless Authorized Key Login on CentOS

Passwordless Authorized Key Login allows you to securely authenticate to a remote server without entering a password each time. In this guide, we will generate the key pair using the ECDSA algorithm which provides better encryption and security.

### Step 1: Generate the ECDSA SSH Key Pair

Access your CentOS system and generate the SSH key pair using the ECDSA algorithm:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa
```

Follow the prompts to generate the key pair. You can accept the default path for the key pair and leave the passphrase blank for passwordless authentication.

To print SSH key pair use the following ls command:

```bash
$ ls -l ~/.ssh
```

### Step 2: Copy Public SSH Key to Remote CentOS Server

Next, copy the public key to the remote CentOS server using the `ssh-copy-id` command:

```bash
ssh-copy-id user@centos-server-IP
```

Replace `user` with your username and `centos-server-IP` with the IP address of your remote CentOS server. Enter `yes` to confirm and provide the password for the remote user when prompted.
